# Ports


Select the serial device of the Arduino board from the Tools | Serial Port menu. On Windows, this should be `COM1` or `COM2` for a serial Arduino board, or `COM3`, `COM4`, or `COM5` for a USB board.

On the Mac, this should be something like `/dev/cu.usbserial-1B1` for a USB board, or something like `/dev/cu.USA19QW1b1P1.1` if using a Keyspan adapter with a serial board (other USB-to-serial adapters use different names).
